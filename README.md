# stellar-testnet
Configuration for deploying a simple Stellar testnet node

## Background
Stellar is a platform that connects banks, payments systems, and people. Integrate with Stellar to move money quickly, reliably, and at almost no cost.  The network is decentralized and global by design. The Stellar network is a worldwide collection of Stellar Cores, each maintained by different people and organizations. The distributed nature of the network makes it reliable and safe.   This project is intended to demonstrate how to extend the existing testnet to host your own stellar core.
